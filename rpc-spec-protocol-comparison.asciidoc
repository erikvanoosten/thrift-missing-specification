== Comparing binary and compact protocol

The binary protocol is fairly simple and therefore easy to process. The compact protocol needs less bytes to send the
same data at the cost of additional processing. When bandwidth is a bottleneck, the compact protocol will be slightly faster.
When bandwidth is not a concern there is no advantage.

.Compatibility

A server could automatically determine whether a client talks the binary protocol or the compact protocol by
investigating the first byte. If the value is `1000 0001` or `0000 0000` (assuming a name shorter than Â±16 MB) it is the
binary protocol. When the value is `1000 0010` it is talking the compact protocol.
